# LibDay
Liberation Day remake from 1998

This project is still very far from being called a game, since almost no progress has been made.
I hope I'll be able to update this sentence in a reasonable amount of time.

Right now, work has started on tools that extract the original game's data to something that can be read from a Unity project, like tsv files, for example.

There's plenty of other data from the original game that still needs to be understood and extracted, like:

- DBI files.
- SMK files
- FF files.
